To keep it simple I keep my file name on numerical order as it was easy for referencing to Anchor Tag,
So here is basically What each 1,2,3,4,5 pages refer to;

1.html----> Home page of my Website.
2.html----> Products Page where my product will be shown.
3.html----> Added Item page where my Added item will be shown
4.html----> Sign in Page where user will login
5.html----> Sign out Page where user will log out
